Capital One is excited to return to OSCON as a sponsor for 2016 and has big plans to highlight creativity and innovative technology in Austin, Texas.

Last July, Capital One introduced [Hygieia](https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia)<sup>SM</sup>, their first open source dashboard product, during OSCON 2015. Since the launch, they have received some great feedback and encouragement from the DevOps community. The statistics are amazing – the GitHub Repo has been forked more than 280 times, received 772 stars, with 102 watching, and 25 contributors.You can also find some good statistics about Hygieia on [Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/Hygieia).

Capital One has been continuously enhancing Hygieia’s feature sets — as of today there have been about 1000 commits from 22 community contributors. We recently released Hygieia 2.0.

This year, Capital One will be camped out at the convention center throughout OSCON. They’ll have project videos and live demos. Drop by to connect, recharge, and learn how they are helping people reimagine how they interact with their money through their next-generation open source financial innovations. In addition, Capital One’s open source team of experts can be found [speaking and moderating panels during the show](http://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/open-source-us/public/schedule/speakers).

Capital One’s team of thinkers, problem solvers, and innovators are challenging themselves to see the world through the eyes of their customers every step of the way. Stop by to get a glimpse of their open source vision and how they are striving to create customer experiences that challenge the perception of banking by putting people first, advancing faster, and simply getting stuff done.
If Capital One’s open source demos and discussions make you think — “I want to be a part of the digital transformation of the banking industry while putting people first” — then their recruiters would love to talk to you. They’ll be in Austin looking for Engineers, Data Scientists, Designers, and Product Managers to join their team to help design the future of the FinTech market.
