Capital One, in partnership with [NumFocus](http://www.numfocus.org/), is hosting [PyData DC 2016](http://pydata.org/dc2016/) this October in McLean, VA. PyData is a conference that brings together analysts, scientists, developers, engineers, architects and others from the data science community to discuss new techniques and tools for the management, analysis, and visualization of data using Python. At Capital One, we work every day to maximize our approach to data while working to change banking for good.

Capital One started with a simple principle – attract talented people and give them the opportunity to be great. Founded in 1988, we harnessed the power of big data to create customized products that disrupted the credit card industry. Over the years, our associates have used our information-based strategy to build a great company, bringing breakthrough banking products and services to consumers, small businesses, and commercial clients. Today, with more than 65-million customers and 40,000 associates worldwide, our Cloud-enabled infrastructure, Open Source culture, and leading-edge data and analytics platforms are fueling Capital One’s position as a digital leader.

We’re excited to have you join us this October for PyData DC 2016 so we can work together to advance data-driven and Python-driven development.
