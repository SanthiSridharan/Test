Here at Capital One, we’re invested in changing banking for good; and sometimes that means helping change the world for good as well. On Saturday, April 2nd, Capital One partnered with [Team Exponent](http://teamexponent.com/) and [Google Developer Group DC](http://www.meetup.com/gdg-dc/) to host a [10x Moonshot Sprint](http://www.meetup.com/gdg-dc/events/229122044/) to work on high-impact solutions to resolving climate change through robotics, artificial intelligence, and biotech.

## Organizing Ideas

[Katy Kasmai](https://twitter.com/KatyKasmai), the founder of Team Exponent, led the more than sixty five engineers, scientists, designers, project managers, and more during the day-long 10x Moonshot Sprint at the Capital One offices in Tysons, VA. Kasmai is the founder of Team Exponent, Inc., a non-profit company focused on building teams around solving humanities toughest challenges through 10x moonshot ideas.

At the event kick-off, a "moonshot" was defined as a big idea that addresses a large, important problem and is both high in value and high in technical complexity. Throughout history, great advances have been made through the pursuit of moonshots. One contemporary example that Kasmai highlighted was the popularity of premium electric vehicles. When the concept of a highly ecological luxury vehicle was first introduced in the early 2000’s, this was a moonshot idea. Given the current popularity of this vehicle category, it’s safe to say the idea is no longer so far-fetched.

## Event Structure

The day itself was divided into team formation, ideation, idea graphing (value + technical complexity), selecting an idea on which to focus, research & prototyping, and the final pitch.

According to the principles of 10X Moonshot events, all ideas pitched have merit. Kasmai encouraged the use of “Yes, and” techniques when discussing ideas. Meaning that, when an idea is pitched, instead of saying *“That is impossible!”* a team should respond with, *“Yes, and...”*

*For example:*

> **Team member 1:** We should get rid of all cars.

> **Team member 2:** Yes, and we can do this through a combination of regulations and providing alternate transit.

Each of the eight teams spent the first part of the day [brainstorming on ideas](https://twitter.com/azat_co/status/716321337560731649). After the brainstorming session, [each team grouped together any ideas that were similar in nature](https://twitter.com/JackieKazil/status/716358800219971586). The ideas, or sets of ideas, were then placed on a grid where *value* was represented on the y-axis and *technical complexity* was represented on the x-axis.

## Shooting for the Moon

Looking for a moonshot, groups focused on the ideas that exhibited the most value, using dot voting to champion their favorites. *(Dot voting is a voting mechanism where individuals get a set number of votes represented as marked dots or stickers on the idea. This technique allows for everyone to have a voice in the direction of a team.)*

During the second half of the day, the teams used the “Yes, and…” technique to focus on what it would take to make their idea a reality. Teams designed and pitched solutions that included everything from [harnessing energy from the Gulf Stream](https://vine.co/v/ijplPPt3I5A) to creating new ways to collect solar power from the sun.

Final ideas were presented and participants voted for their “favorite” idea; in this case a coating that could turn buildings into “super trees” capable of taking in sunlight and CO2 and releasing oxygen.

## Thank You’s

Capital One supports innovation, community-oriented events, and big-picture thinking in all it’s forms. [A big thank you to Kasmai, the 10X Moonshot team, and all the participants for their complex, technical thinking on this important subject!](https://twitter.com/KatyKasmai/status/716416014171373568)
