Hygieia has come a long way in just 8 months, and we’re excited to be along for the ride!  Last July I published a [post](http://www.capitalone.io/blog/hygieia-making-sense-out-of-your-devops-tools/) about our product Hygieia. We then launched the product during [OSCON 2015](http://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/open-source-2015). Since the launch we have received some great feedbacks and encouragement from the DevOps community. As of today, the statistics are amazing – the [GitHub Repo](http://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia) has been forked more than 200 times, received 500+ stars. You can also find some good statistics about Hygieia on [openhub](https://www.openhub.net/p/Hygieia).

We have been continuously enhancing Hygieia’s feature sets – as of today there have been about 1000 commits from 22 community contributors.We recently released Hygieia 2.0. Read more about it [here](https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia/blob/master/Hygieia2.md).

If your organization is investing in DevOps, Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery; Hygieia is one tool that you will want to include in your tools chain.
