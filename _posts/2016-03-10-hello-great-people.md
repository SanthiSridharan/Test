Starting something new is exhilarating, daring and, at times, even daunting.  People who create know this. Having an idea isn’t the hardest part. Getting that idea off the ground is – building adoption, clarifying value, then scaling that idea to realize its full impact in the world.

And it’s no different for companies.  

Capital One knows about creating new things.  We were founded on the belief that information, technology and great people could combine to bring new, highly customized financial products directly to consumers.  It was daunting, and exhilarating.  But less than three decades later – with more than 65 million customer accounts and 45,000 great employees – you could say we’ve proven that original concept.  You could also say we’re not satisfied yet – and want to accomplish the same with the development community.

So today, we’re starting something new again by becoming one of the first banks to open our platform to external developers and partners. We are launching __Capital One DevExchange__.

Every experienced developer will tell you that before they invest their time with a platform, they need to know that the basics are covered. Foundational things like:

* APIs that matter, are easy to integrate and are standards-based.
* A portal where they can explore all the capabilities – from documentation and sample code and reference applications, to high-quality support and access to the community and relevant thought leaders.
* A place where they can easily test their concepts, have robust test data analytics and get instant access to prove their ideas.
* A place where feedback matters and there is an opportunity to explore ideas with like-minded people.
* Lastly and most importantly, a program that operates with transparency and a commitment to long-term sustainability.

Building a sustainable, vibrant developer community is hard work. It isn't just about APIs, SDKs or toolkits. It’s about working together to solve problems. Engaging community members wherever they are.  Defining a long-term strategy that benefits all its members.  Creating real revenue and business value to flow to everyone. Promoting those successes.  And doing the hard work every day of supporting, servicing, communicating with, adjusting when necessary, and expanding the ecosystem around the community.

We are creating such a place.  A place where ideas become tangible.  A place to access technology that is essential to people’s everyday lives – money, finances, and identity.  A place we call Capital One DevExchange.

It’s time that banking and financial services catch up to the rest of our digital-enabled lives.  We still believe that information, technology and great people are the magical combination needed to drive innovation.  But we also know that great people – especially great developers, engineers, and product visionaries – are everywhere.  And we want to work with them, with you.

The challenge isn’t just to convince you to devote your engineering and development resources to working with us.  It’s also to make sure you have a voice in this community. 

We are passionate about this type of authentic, open interaction – after all, we named the platform DevExchange!  Today, we are launching our inaugural Beta program and inviting you to check out our first set of APIs.  Get registered – and start working with our first set of APIs. Tell us how to make our products better, the community experience better, the process easier for you. Send us feedback at [devexchange@capitalone.com](mailto:devexchange@capitalone.com) or send an email directly to me at [baldgeek@capitalone.com](mailto:baldgeek@capitalone.com).

Let’s start something new together.  We can’t wait to see – what’s in your app!
